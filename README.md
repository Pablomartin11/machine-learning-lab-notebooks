[![es](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-es-red.svg)](/README-ES.md)

This repository contains all the experiments carried out in the _Data Mining_ course of the Computer Engineering degree at the University of Valladolid. Here you can find all kinds of practices for data adjustment and prediction using a variety of models.

- KMeans and Agglomerative Algorithm.
- KMeans with initial center calculation using the Ward Algorithm
- Self Organizing Map adjusted to a dataset.
- Application of a RNN Elman, LSTM, and GRU.
- Convolutional Networks - VGG Architecture
- Scaled dot product Attention - Transformers
